# The A10 residue interface + the deep-cycle dissolution

Two landings from the gtz3-a10-confinement workflow (both audits SOUND),
converging with `Gtz.TriangleClosure` from the independent Poncelet round.

INTERFACE: A10 (zero-set confinement, `{Φ = 1} ∩ K ⊆ closure(𝒯)`) is
mechanized as a consumer theorem over the kernel's real vocabulary — the
classification through ≤ 11 atoms, the structural dichotomy, and the
deep-cycle residue Prop are isolated hypotheses, never smuggled. The
CyclicStress layer pins the residue onto the Cayley-torsion locus.

DISSOLUTION: on the focal conic `ν = 1/2 + ρc` (which every equality-design
atom satisfies via the frame form), an atom's two tight partners are ALWAYS
mutually tight — the P3-closure gap times the chord norm is EXACTLY
`(ρ² − 1/4)(c₁² + s₁² − 1)/4`, zero on the unit circle, with NO
design-compatibility hypothesis. Combined with max-degree-2, every tight
component is a triangle: the deep-cycle residue predicate is empty on the
planar shadow, and the residue Prop holds vacuously. The honest remainder
is the planar→3D frame bridge (the flagged B5 Gordan/IFT step), NOT the
cycles.

/-- **Φ = 1, in the kernel's real vocabulary** (an exact tie). The best

/-- **A tie yields a tight direction** — the Rayleigh/KKT certificate's non-vacuity.
The dominating subset of a tie has a gap matrix `S_C − I` that is PSD (`Dominates`)
yet NOT positive-definite (no `k`-subset dominates strictly), hence singular: it
admits a NONZERO null vector `w` with `w ⬝ᵥ ((S_C − I) *ᵥ w) = 0`. That is exactly
the tight-direction hypothesis the whole `Gtz.RayleighCertificate` chain consumes —
so every ACTUAL tie feeds the per-direction KKT machinery (eigenvector, Frobenius
coupling, complementary slackness, gap-operator annihilation); the certificate is
not vacuous. Extracted from `¬ PosDef` by `posDef_iff_dotProduct_mulVec` +
`push_neg` (a nonzero direction with nonpositive Rayleigh value), pinned to zero
against the PSD lower bound. -/

/-- **Two routes agree at the zero set**: if the funneling law held on the
class (`margin ≥ lawConst · dist^alpha`), confinement would be immediate —
at a tie the margin vanishes, so the distance does. A10's point is that the
law is NOT known; this certifies the classification route and the law route
target the same statement. -/

/-- **Focal-conic P3-closure** (the residue dissolution, unconditional):
atom 1 is a unit vector `(c1, s1)` on the focal conic `ν = 1/2 + ρc`; its
two tight partners are the intersections of its polar chord with the unit
circle, encoded by the Vieta data. Then the partners are TIGHT to each
other — the conic tightness gap vanishes — with NO design-compatibility
hypothesis. With max-degree-2 this closes every tight walk into a triangle:
the deep-cycle residue is empty on the planar shadow. -/

distinct atoms cannot form a chordless tight 4-cycle — the closure at `b`
