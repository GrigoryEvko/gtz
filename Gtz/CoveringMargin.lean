# The quantified covering margin: H3a's arithmetic core

The gaps-stability workflow's covering theorem runs on one explicit margin:
`η₀(ℓ̄,τ) = 1/(2(2 + ℓ̄√m + ℓ̄²/τ))`. Its kernel content is pure ordered-field
arithmetic, (ℓ̄,τ,m)-generic:

* the margin is positive on the essential-configuration space;
* the margin obeys the display bound `η₀ ≤ τ/(2ℓ̄²)` — the shape every
  consumer quotes;
* the stability constant `C_H = 6/η₀` is bounded by `12(2 + ℓ̄√m + ℓ̄²/τ)/12
  = ...` — kernel form: `C_H·τ ≤ 12·(2τ + ℓ̄√m·τ + ℓ̄²)`, division-free;
* the uncovered-atom multiplier bound: a weight floor `τ/ℓ̄` against a
  certificate error `η` prices the multiplier at `|μ₀| ≤ η(1 + ℓ̄²/τ)` —
  the (e)-step of the margin proof, one inequality.
