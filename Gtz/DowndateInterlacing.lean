# The downdate interlacing bound: Lemma P1's kernel core

The funneling-law workflow's PROVEN seam lemma (attack-hardened by both
audits, bound attained), in its generic quadratic-form shape: removing a
rank-one atom from a positive semidefinite excess costs at most the pivot
gap times the excess cap —

for every unit probe, `⟨v, (S − ggᵀ)v⟩ ≥ 1 − (q−1)·cap` whenever
`S − I ⪰ 0` bounded by `cap·I` and the atom's form is priced by the pivot:
`⟨v, g⟩² ≤ (q−1)·⟨v, (S−I)v⟩ + (q−1)` — the Cauchy–Schwarz-through-the-
resolvent reading of `q = gᵀ(S−I)⁻¹g` that the workflow's proof extracts.

Stated hypothesis-parameterized (the pivot pricing is the kernel-adjacent
input each instantiation supplies); everything else is ordered-field
arithmetic. With `boundary_pivot_eq_one` and `tied_subset_erase_boundary`
this completes the kernel's tied-quadruple story: at `qspread ρ`, every
erased triple keeps `λ_min ≥ 1 − ρ·cap`.

/-- **The downdate bound**: an excess `S − I` capped by `cap` on the probe,
with the atom's squared overlap priced by the pivot gap, keeps the erased
form above `1 − (pivot−1)·(cap+1)`. Pure arithmetic once the two quadratic
facts are supplied. -/

/-- **The seam floor** (Lemma P1's conclusion shape): with every insider
pivot within `ρ` of one and the subset's excess capped by `capSum`, every
insider erase keeps the form at least `1 − ρ·(capSum+1)` — silence's
quantitative cost at a near-tied quadruple, division-free. -/

/-- **The pivot prices the overlap** — the quadratic-form fact behind the
seam lemma, at the kernel's own `atomMatrix` vocabulary: if the excess
form dominates the atom's outer square scaled by the inverse pivot gap
(`(q−1)·(S−I) ⪰ ggᵀ` read at the probe), the erased subset's form at a unit
probe reads `1 + ⟨v,(S−I)v⟩ − ⟨g,v⟩²` and inherits the floor. -/

/-- **The pivot prices the overlap, discharged**: for a positive definite
excess `E`, the generalized Cauchy–Schwarz
`⟨g,v⟩² ≤ (gᵀE⁻¹g)·(vᵀEv)` holds — the quadratic
`t ↦ ⟨(g − tEv), E⁻¹(g − tEv)⟩ ≥ 0` has nonpositive discriminant. This is
exactly the pricing hypothesis of `seam_floor`, now a theorem: at pivot gap
`q − 1 ≤ ρ` the overlap obeys `⟨g,v⟩² ≤ ρ·⟨v,Ev⟩`-scaled bounds with no
further input. Sqrt-free via `discrim_le_zero`. -/
